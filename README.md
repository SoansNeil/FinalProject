# FinalProject

## Description
<ul>This application allows users to interact with a map of the world. The map implements interactive points which represent soccer teams in the world. A user is able to interact with the points or search for the team using a searchbar which will be followed by a quick overview of the history/achievements of the team. The application allows for filtered searches by leagues, country, and favorite teams.</ul>

## Tech Stack
<li>Frontend: React.js + Tailwind CSS</li>
<li>Backend: Node.js + Express.js</li>
<li>Database: MongoDB</li>
<li>AI Integration: Open AI API</li>
<li>Deployment: Google Cloud (GCP)</li>

## AI Utilization
<p>I used AI thoroughly to help me develop the structure and code of the repository. I structured some of the files like the frontend and backend along with the docker files but most of the other files came from the chatbot developing subfiles for the prompts I was providing. It created the connections, js files, and css files for the javaScript files. The artificial intelligence also helped debug the files which caused me issues during deployment.

I am still struggling to deploy the backend through GCP b/c of an issue with the code regarding a port or an issue with the GCP not connecting with my database. Either issue I do not know how to fix and it is prohibiting me from moving onto the next step which is frontend deployment. I consulted AI to see if it could guide me in the right direction but it did not make much sense to me.

After a little outside help and utilization of AI I was able to successfully deploy the backend and therefore deployed the frontend along with it. The app is successfully deployed, but needs pipelines, integration of artificial intelligence, and renaming the containers to something more consistent with my application.</p>
